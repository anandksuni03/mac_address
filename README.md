<h1>For Finding Mac Address of your ESP8266</h1>

<h2>What is mac address?</h2>
Media Access Control is referred to as <b>MAC</b>. <br>
It's a protocol that facilitates communication between devices connected to a network.<br>
MAC address is a unique identification.<br>
It functions similar to your device's physical address.<br>
It serves as the device's network-level identity, much like your home address does for your residence.

<h2>What is the advantage for using MAC address</h2>

. Unique Identification<br>
. Device Tracking and Monitoring<br>
. Can implement ESP_NOW protocols<br>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

1.Arduino ide<br>
2.ESP 8266 Dev board<br>
3.USB cable<br>
4.Should installed ESP 8266 board in your Arduino ide<br>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

1.Open Arduino ide<br>
2.install the ESP board in the board manager section in arduino ide<br>
3.Download the ino file and open in arduino ide<br>
4.Connect the ESP 8266 to your computer using USB cable<br>
5.Select the board Generic ESP8266 and select the port<br>
6.Set the baud rate to 9600<br>
7.Upload the code to your ESP<br>
8.Open the Serial monitor and we can see the mac address there
